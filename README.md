# StarCount
This is my first app developed in swift using storyboard

The idea of this app is to think about what factors makes us to see more or less stars, like obstacles, clouds, light, eye capacity, etc. You estimate numbers (%) of this variables and the app returns the estimated value of visible stars based on voices in my head.
